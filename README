Contributing
------------
	- ensure that you follow the main format when adding new quotes.
	- do not remove quotes in PR's; if you do, you'd better give a very good reason for doing so.
	- add new quotes at the bottom.
	- remember: I am under no obligation to you to merge your patches; if you dislike the fact that your PR wasn't merged, either fork this repo or f*** off.
